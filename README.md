# Emoji-Card-Game
A fun super customizable emoji guessing card matching game, made using vanilla JavaScript, lots of css animations and the native HTML drag and drop API

## Local Setup

## Contributing
Would love PRs adding more decks of cards! Any fun SFW topic is welcome! Detailed instructions might be added later, but for now simply observe the decks currently present and follow a similar pattern. Also make sure to discuss the topic and initial idea for a deck by creating an issue for the same, before investing time in a full PR.

This project is not looking for any feature enhancements right now, so any issues you create for anything apart from new decks will be closed, at least for the meanwhile. 

But you may want to keep an eye out for any issues created by me for specific tasks that I would appreciate help with!
